## 🏛️ System Overview

UniSphere is the enterprise digital infrastructure of Chanakya University. Engineered for high-concurrency university administration, research facilitation, and automated academic operations, UniSphere delivers complete coverage across the student and faculty lifecycle:

1. **Multi-Page Public Portal**: Deep-linked, bookmarkable public web interface with dedicated routes for Institutional Overview, 6-School Academic Explorer, 174-Faculty Directory, Campus Facilities, Events, and Admissions Pipeline.
2. **Autonomous Academic Subsystems**: 8 independent team modules isolated by client-side `ModuleErrorBoundary` containers, 3-state `CircuitBreaker` proxies, namespaced `IsolatedStorage` partitions, and a sandboxed `CampusEventBus`.
3. **Institutional Governance & Security**: Real-time WAF telemetry, cryptographic audit trails, automated DPDP Act 2023 compliance isolation, and tamper-proof digital credentials.
4. **Offline-First & Hybrid Cloud Storage**: Unified LocalStorage engine for instant zero-latency development and demonstration, with hot-swappable Firebase Firestore & Storage production connectivity.

## 🌐 Public Website Architecture (Multi-Page Router)

The public landing experience (`src/components/landing/`) is structured as a modular Multi-Page Application powered by hash-based routing (`#home`, `#about`, `#academics`, `#faculty`, `#campus`, `#events`, `#admissions`):

| Route | View Component | Key Features & Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| `#home` | [`LandingHomePage.tsx`](src/components/landing/pages/LandingHomePage.tsx) | Dynamic Admissions CTA, Live Academic Statistics strip, 4 Institutional Pillars, Campus Events teaser. |
| `#about` | [`LandingAboutPage.tsx`](src/components/landing/pages/LandingAboutPage.tsx) | Board of Governors, Chancellor & Vice-Chancellor leadership profiles, statutory accreditation framework. |
| `#academics` | [`LandingAcademicsPage.tsx`](src/components/landing/pages/LandingAcademicsPage.tsx) | Interactive tabbed explorer across all 6 constituent schools (Engineering, Management, Humanities, Science, Law, Indian Studies) with detailed programme specs and apply hooks. |
| `#faculty` | [`LandingFacultyPage.tsx`](src/components/landing/pages/LandingFacultyPage.tsx) | Full directory of **174 faculty members** with instantaneous text search, school/department filtering, publication counts, and verified email links. |
| `#campus` | [`LandingCampusPage.tsx`](src/components/landing/pages/LandingCampusPage.tsx) | High-resolution campus media carousel, emergency contact registry, structured facility showcases (NVIDIA AI Center, Solar PV Lab, Central Library, Research Complex). |
| `#events` | [`LandingEventsPage.tsx`](src/components/landing/pages/LandingEventsPage.tsx) | 3-column event catalog with calendar actions, symposium listings, and hackathon registration forms. |
| `#admissions` | [`LandingAdmissionsPage.tsx`](src/components/landing/pages/LandingAdmissionsPage.tsx) | 4-step admissions roadmap, UG/PG fee structures, statutory document checklist, and interactive apply modal. |

## 👥 Institutional Roles & Test Accounts

UniSphere enforces strict, zero-trust role-based access control across **11 distinct institutional personas**. Each persona has tailor-made module scopes, privacy isolation, and authorization gates:

| # | Role Key | Test Username | Test Persona & Description | Accessible Modules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `SUPER_ADMIN` | `admin` | Dr. R. Sharma (System Administrator) | All 17 internal modules + WAF & Governance |
| 2 | `STUDENT` | `student` | Arjun Kumar (MCA Sem 3, Roll: 24MCA003) | Attendance QR, CodeArena, Exams, PresentAI, UniHub, TrackIt |
| 3 | `FACULTY` | `faculty` | Dr. Priya Nair (Associate Professor, CSE) | QR Kiosk, 60:40 NEP Grading, Question Authoring, Viva Scoring |
| 4 | `HOD` | `hod` | Dr. A. K. Sundaram (Head of Computing) | Department Workload, Leave Approvals, Curriculum Allocations |
| 5 | `DEAN` | `dean` | Prof. M. S. Rao (Dean of Engineering) | School-Level KPIs, Recruitment Dossiers, Research Grants |
| 6 | `PROCTOR` | `proctor` | Prof. Vikram Sen (Chief Proctor) | Attendance Defaulters (<75%), Medical Leave Proofs, Gate Logs |
| 7 | `EXAM_CONTROLLER`| `coe` | Dr. S. K. Venkatesh (Controller of Exams) | Master Timetable, 75% Gate, Digital Hall Tickets, Transcripts |
| 8 | `ADMISSION_OFFICER`| `admissions` | Ms. Sunita Roy (Admissions Officer) | Lead Ingestion, Document Verification, Fee Receipts, Enrolment |
| 9 | `PLACEMENT_OFFICER`| `placements` | Mr. Rakesh Menon (Corporate Relations) | Drive Coordinator, Student Eligibility Filters, Recruiter Portal |
| 10| `BURSAR` | `bursar` | CA Ramesh Chand (Finance Officer) | Student Fee Ledgers, Faculty Payroll, Bank Reconciliation |
| 11| `AUDITOR` | `auditor` | External Quality Assurance Cell (NAAC/NIRF) | Read-only compliance audit, immutable logs, SSR exports |

> **Authentication Credentials Note:** For all test personas, use the respective username with password `password123` (or any valid preset configured in [`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`](src/context/AuthContext.tsx)). Invalid passwords trigger strict authentication rejection.

## 🧩 Autonomous Subsystem Modules (Monorepo Layout)

Each subsystem resides in `src/modules/` and conforms to strict modularity guidelines:

## 🛡️ Security & Zero-Trust Architecture

UniSphere enforces an exhaustive cybersecurity posture:

1. **Route & Component-Level Authorization**: Direct URL manipulation or programmatic view switching to unauthorized modules triggers a dedicated **Access Denied** panel featuring the user's role badge, the requested module name, and an automatic safe navigation link.
2. **DPDP Act 2023 Compliance**: Student health justifications, biometric face recordings, and GPS coordinates are quarantined and rendered only to the specific student and authorized proctors.
3. **Information Leakage Suppression**:
   - Master institutional timetables are completely inaccessible to students (enforced at sidebar, module navigation, and component render layers).
   - CodeArena plagiarism inspection tools are hidden and blocked from student roles.
   - Examination authoring and evaluation studios are strictly gated to faculty and exam controllers.
4. **Input Sanitization & Sandboxing**: All form inputs, search fields, and terminal code executions are sanitized and run in isolated sandboxed contexts.
5. **Zero Emojis Mandate**: Strict adherence to enterprise institutional aesthetics utilizing Lucide SVG icons exclusively.
